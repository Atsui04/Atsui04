## Yo 👋

I am a beginner frontend developer, I am still learning, but I hope that I will succeed in the future.

I'm just a simple guy who likes to develop websites, there aren't many of them at the moment, but I hope to increase both the number and the quality of them in the future.

I like working with js, react, html/css, in the future I want to learn more about ts and tailwind.

Fun facts:
- I love cats very much, and I have an incredibly cute Scottish tabby cat
- I am a big football fan, my favorite club is Barcelona and my favorite player is Pedri (Messi in general)
- I like to play games sometimes, my favorite genre is souls-like
- I like to watch anime, my favorites are Bleach and Re Zero
